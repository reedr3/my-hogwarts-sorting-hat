Welcome to Hogwarts! Before you begin your studies, you must be sorted into your house! While here, your house will be like your family. Are you ready to begin?

Would you like to hear my sorting song? If you would like to hear my song, just say "Begin song". If you want to skip to the sorting, say "Begin sorting ceremony."

**list of 3 songs to choose from, plays one, then begins sorting automatically**
OR
**begins sorting**
((maybe have it say "sorting is a personal matter so put headphones in while i ask you questions" or "go ahead, try me on and i will sort you! put on your headphones/headband"))

List of hat quotes, uses one before each question.
List of questions. (maybe have some quotes and questions tied together?)

have certain subset of questions always present (v small subset though, for replayability): which house don't want, some fundamental quality question, maybe one Multiple-Choice-Fragen
have list of amount of questions possible, like 5 q quiz, 7 q quiz, 9, etc.. chooses a length at random each time it sorts a student

((maybe have it say, "i've reached my decision, remove the headphones so i may announce your house"))
have it declare house at end (wish i could make this outloud and rest in headphones, oh well) (phrases like better be.. or i know just what to do with you!)
then have it recite corresponding house poem (maybe cycling between years 1, 4, 5 versions)

Are there any more students left to be sorted? If so, say "Continue sorting". If the student just sorted would like to ask me any questions or question my judgement, you may do so now. Simply say "I have a question". Otherwise, if the ceremony is over, say "Mischieft managed" and I will leave you for now.
(this bit needs work because it's too long to remember the three phrase options by the end.. break it up somehow?)

**begins sorting over again (with different questions and possibly different number of questions, etc.)**
OR
**says "Bee in your bonnet?" and then "what question can i answer for you? pick one of the following and simply say the number that corresponds to the question you want to ask" and then list a few
questions, including "did you put me in the right house", "why do some students have more questions than others?", and maybe one or two more.
--> each of these questions leads to a witty answer and the question "did you have another question? if so, say "i have a question". otherwise, to continue sorting the next student say "continue sorting". or if the sorting ceremony is finished, say "mischeif managed"."
OR
**exits game, perhaps with a witty farewell of some kind**

:D
