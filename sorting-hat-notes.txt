* make game be able to be a different length everytime you play (cause sorting hat is fast with some, slow with others)

*** have a question asking them if they had to wish to not be in one house, which would it be (eg. "not slytherin")

*** have questions designed so that answers can indicate just one or multipe houses (so have some questions where a = 3 pts to gryffindor count,
b = 3 pts to ravenclaw count, etc. and other questions where a = 1 pt to g, r, and h, and b = 3 pts to slytherin. get creative)

* have it read house short poems when you get sorted (use only book one poems? or 4 and 5 too?)

* have an option to have it sing a sorting song or start the sorting (have it shuffle between the three sorting songs)

* give it sorting hat phrases to say between questions, etc.

have a comment like, "ah a history of X house in your family, i see. interesting.."

* come up with a more clever name for app

* and a more clever invocation (would love to use i solemnly swear i am up to no good and mischeif managed, but alas..)

***** have questions so users can answer with words, not numbers..

*** figure out ways to handle/avoid ties

have user be able to ask why some people take longer and hat answers some minds are clearer choices than others

* may need to give it a list of acceptable answer words. also maybe a list of the house names.. proper names that weird may be beyond it..

omg! need to have an extra where they ask to be resorted or if the hat was right and it asks bee in your bonnet?
